# Healthcare_Management

This project is a simple command-line Health Manager that runs multiple health-risk assessment tests based on user inputs. The goal is to provide a beginner-friendly yet practical Python program that analyzes lifestyle and health indicators, calculates a risk score, and visualizes results using Matplotlib.

Project Overview

The program collects basic personal details (age, gender, height, weight) and computes BMI.
Based on the user’s selections, it runs up to 10 different health tests, including:

Lifestyle Health Risk

Heart Disease Risk

Diabetes Early Warning

Mental Stress Tracker

Vital Signs Monitor

Obesity & Fitness Risk

Immunity Tracker

Air Quality Health Risk

COVID / Flu Risk

Senior Citizen Risk


Each test returns:

Test Name

Health Score (0–100)

Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)

Suggested advice


All selected test results are then plotted together on a professional line graph for easy comparison.
